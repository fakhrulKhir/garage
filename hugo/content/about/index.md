Hi there, 

I started with this computer-thingy since Im still a kid. In love of breaking stuffs and making them work again. Not a good person to talk to but a good listener. Im only listen, bad at responding. 

Back in primary shcool, people call me Khir. It changed to Fakhrul when I am in high school. And now, most of my friends called me Sam. However, I usually on the net by the handle "runtosky".

Hope you are doing fine. Here I jot down some of my stuffs that might be needed in the future (as reference?). I also will post some of my cyber security and software developments expreriences here. This includes some of my previous cyber security trainings, challenges and CTF joined.

Interested in software engineering and cyber security stuffs. Currently filling my time with sysadmin works and learning all the way I can (I am still an undergraduate student too).

Credits to my officemate, Wildan. I looked and used Hugo from him.

Shout out to him!

Hi there, 

I started with this computer-thingy since Im still a kid. In love of breaking stuffs and making them work again. Not a good person to talk to but a good listener. Im only listen, bad at responding. 


Hope you are doing fine. Here I jot down some of my stuffs that might be needed in the future (as reference?). I also will post some of my cyber security and software developments expreriences here. This includes some of my previous cyber security trainings, challenges and CTF joined.

I am interested in software engineering and cyber security stuffs. Currently filling my time with DevOps works and learning the best way I can (I am still an undergraduate student too).

Credits to my officemate, Wildan. I looked and used Hugo from him.

Shout out to him!
